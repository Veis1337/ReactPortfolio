# Michael Weiss React Portfolio Page

## Description

This project is a portfolio page for myself to showcase the projects that I have built to potential employers. 
The motivation behind this project was to blow the HTML/CSS portfolio I built 5 months ago out of the water.
In this project I was able to implement tailwind over vanilla CSS, use React components to structure the page, and 
provide functionality I couldn't have dreamed up at the beginning of my coding journey.
